<!-- ## 📖 About the Project  -->
<h2 name="about-the-project">𐙚 About the project </h2>

Wheelzy is a car rental platform built using Ruby on Rails, with Bootstrap for styling and a touch of JavaScript for interactivity. The platform allows users to connect with local car owners and rent vehicles for different occasions, all while offering a seamless experience for booking, managing reservations, and viewing available cars.

This project aims to offer a simple yet powerful interface to manage car rentals efficiently, using a database-driven approach with user authentication for managing bookings.
